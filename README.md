# Arduino Force Meter
A real-time, Python program that reads the calculated force, newtons and time from the I/O serial data stream of an Arduino with a Force sensor and displays the data to a TKinter GUI, writes recorded event sessions to CSV files and generates graphs using Matplotlib to represent the recorded data in a PyQt5 framework.
